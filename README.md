_“Our vision is to empower citizens and rescuers in facing a thousand disasters.“_

Developed for the Seoul National University x Meta Metaverse Policy Hackathon, this frontend-only application delivers a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' game that leverages the Open AI API to dynamically render each step and scene.

**To start:** <br />
Clone the repo<br />
Add your own Open AI API key (suggested in an .env file)

**In terminal:** <br />
npm install <br />
npm start

**Note:**
This repo was built solo over the space of a week - it is passenger one on the hot mess express. I took some (okay, many) liberties for the purposes of speed so it does not fully represent best practices, just many 2am finishes.   

I also would like to reference this tutorial from Gentle Bull Co on medium for providing a lot of the direction for prompt engineering with Open ai: https://gentlebullco.medium.com/turn-chatgpt-into-an-open-ended-choose-your-own-adventure-game-and-role-play-any-story-you-want-ad4572cb9077
